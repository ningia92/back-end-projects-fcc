# Request Header Parser Microservice

The Request Header Parser Microservice project on freeCodeCamp involves building an API endpoint (/api/whoami) that returns a JSON object containing information extracted from the client's request headers. Specifically, the API will return the user's IP address, preferred language, and operating system/browser details. This project helps you understand how to access and parse request headers in a Node.js and Express environment, providing valuable practice in API development. The full stack JavaScript app must be functionally similar to [this](https://request-header-parser-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/.).
