# URL Shortener Microservice

The URL Shortener Microservice project on freeCodeCamp is focused on building a microservice that takes in a URL, shortens it, and allows users to retrieve the original URL using the shortened version.

Here are the main features you need to implement:
  1. POST a URL: Users can send a POST request with a URL to /api/shorturl. The service will generate and return a shortened version of the URL as part of a JSON response, containing both the original and short URLs.
  2. Handle Invalid URLs: If the user submits an invalid URL that doesnâ€™t follow the standard http(s)://www.example.com format, the API will return an error message in JSON format, such as {"error":"invalid URL"}.
  3. Redirection: When a user visits the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original website associated with that short URL.

This project helps you practice working with routing, database interaction (storing URLs), and HTTP requests in a Node.js and Express environment.
